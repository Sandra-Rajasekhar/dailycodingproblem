problem:

Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings. The basic idea is to represent repeated successive characters as a single count and character. For example, the string "AAAABBBCCDAA" would be encoded as "4A3B2C1D2A".

solution:

s=input("Enter a string: ")
count=1
prev=s[0]
result=''
for i in range(1,len(s)):
    if prev==s[i]:
        count+=1
    else:
        result+=str(count)+prev
        count=1
        prev=s[i]
result+=str(count)+prev
print("The string",s,"would be encoded as",result)

output:

Enter a string: AAAABBBCCDAA
The string AAAABBBCCDAA would be encoded as 4A3B2C1D2A
