problem:

Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once. You must buy before you can sell it.

For example, given [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10], you should return 5, since you could buy the stock at 5 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars.

solution:

l=list(map(int,input("Enter stcok prices: ").split()))
result=-900000
for i in range(len(l)-1):
    for j in range(i+1,len(l)):
        if result<l[j]-l[i]:
            result=l[j]-l[i]

print("maximum profit: ",result)        

output:

Enter stcok prices: 9 11 8 5 7 10
maximum profit:  5
